Here are some questions you should try to answer:
What's the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?
What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
What time of year is the cheapest time to go to San Francisco? What about the busiest?*/

Mission  had the most listings, far and away, and an average number of reviews per listing and reviews per month.
Western Addition, Castro, Bernal Heights, and Noe Valley would complete the top of my list for most popular neighborhoods
by these criteria. If I had data on whether or not the room was occupied, I would look to see occupancy rate by neighborhood. 
It would also be worth investigating how many reviews were positive, negative, and neutral(like auto-generated cancellation responses).*/

Again, I wish I had data based on occupancy, but I do not and so I had to rely on comments. Bias from this analysis could result from 
reviewers waiting until some month after their trip to write their review and some months correlating with a higher percentage of guests
writing reviews than in other months (e.g. the beautiful summer weather making people feel more like writing glowing reveiws than
the dismal winter weather). Also of note, September and October were the highest priced months though August and July received
the most reviews. This could be due to greater supply in the summer months driving down prices. Let's check with the following query*/

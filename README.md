# Projects from Thinkful Data Science Program

The files within this repository are projects and drills created while studying in the Thinkful Data Science Flex program. 

As of 2/18/2019, the projects completed on the datasets of my choice include the Analytic Report and Research Proposals submitted on the NFL Punt Analytics dataset and the Preparation for Modeling on the World Bank Educational Statistics dataset. Those files labeled 'Drill' were completed as a check for understanding while going through the course material.

## To-Do: 
 - Rename drills to represent content covered instead of unit.lesson.topic
 - Organize like files into directories
 - Flesh out README file
